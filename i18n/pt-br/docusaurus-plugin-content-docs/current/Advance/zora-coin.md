# SkateHive + Zora Integration Guide

## Overview

SkateHive now connects to Zora's platform, letting you turn posts into coins that people can trade.

## What does "post to coin" mean?

### The basic idea

When you create a coin from a post, you're making that content into something people can buy and sell. Think of it like shares in that specific content.

### How it works

1. You post skating content
2. Community likes it (votes, comments)
3. You or someone else creates a coin from it
4. People can now trade that coin
5. If the content stays popular, coin value might go up

> If user had Ethereum and Hive wallet the coins is posted or edited under user Hive and Ethereum accounts. All your posts will be visible on Zora, Skatehive and all the other hive websites. If the user only has an Ethereum wallet, @SkateDev account will register the Coining on Hive blockchain automatically

### For creators

- Make money when people buy your coins

### For coin buyers

- Support creators you believe in
- Might make profit if creator becomes popular
- Get in early on promising skaters
- Future: might get special access or voting rights

### For the platform

- Small fees from trades help keep SkateHive running
- More trading means more activity
- Connects Hive community to Ethereum ecosystem
- Creates new ways for skaters to make money
