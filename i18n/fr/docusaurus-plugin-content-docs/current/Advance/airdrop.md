#### First Time with EVM Airdrops?

* If this is your **first time interacting with an EVM airdrop**, your wallet will ask for permission to interact with the airdrop contract.
* Once granted, the **second transaction** should trigger automatically.
* If it doesn’t, simply **click the button again**. (_We’re improving this process._)
