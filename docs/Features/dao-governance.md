# DAO & Governance

Skatehive operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Community members participate in governance through voting and proposals.

---

## 🏛️ Overview

Skatehive's governance is powered by two systems:
- **Nouns Builder** - On-chain governance on Base network
- **Hive Governance** - Witness voting and proposal discussions

Together, these create a skater-owned, skater-run community.

---

## 🗳️ How Governance Works

### Nouns Builder DAO

Skatehive uses [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build/) for on-chain governance:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **NFTs** | Each auction NFT = 1 vote |
| **Proposals** | On-chain proposals for treasury spending |
| **Voting** | NFT holders vote on proposals |
| **Treasury** | Community funds managed by DAO |
| **Execution** | Approved proposals execute automatically |

### Hive Governance

On the Hive blockchain:
- Vote for **witnesses** who run the network
- Participate in community **discussions**
- Stake **Hive Power** for influence

---

## 🎨 Skatehive NFTs

### Daily Auctions

Every day (or set interval), a new Skatehive NFT is minted and auctioned:
1. Unique, programmatically generated artwork
2. Auction runs for 24 hours
3. Highest bidder wins the NFT
4. All proceeds go to the treasury

### NFT Benefits
