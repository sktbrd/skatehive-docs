# DAO & Governance

Skatehive operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with treasuries on both Hive and Ethereum. The community collectively manages resources and makes decisions.

***

## 🏛️ Overview

Skatehive governance spans two blockchains:

* **Hive**: Community voting, rewards, witness
* **Ethereum (Base)**: NFT auctions, treasury, proposals

The DAO page shows treasury assets and governance links.

## 💰 Treasury Accounts

### Hive Accounts

| Account      | Purpose                |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| `skatehive`  | Main community account |
| `steemskate` | Legacy OG account      |
| `gnars`      | Gnars DAO integration  |

These accounts hold HIVE, HP, and HBD for community use.

### Ethereum Addresses

## 🗳️ Nouns Builder

Skatehive uses **Nouns Builder** on Base network for NFT-based governance:

### How It Works

1. **Daily Auctions**: One NFT auctioned every 24 hours
2. **NFT = Vote**: Each NFT gives 1 vote in proposals
3. **Treasury**: Auction proceeds go to DAO treasury
4. **Proposals**: NFT holders can create and vote on proposals

### Participating

1. Win an NFT in a daily auction
2. Hold the NFT in your wallet
3. Vote on active proposals
4. Create proposals (if threshold met)
