## ❓ FAQ

### Where are my tokens stored?
Your tokens are on the blockchain (Hive or Ethereum). Skatehive just displays them - we never hold your funds.

### Is my wallet secure?
Yes. Skatehive uses Hive Keychain and standard Ethereum wallet connections. Your keys stay in your wallet, never on our servers.

### Why can't I see my Ethereum tokens?
Make sure you've connected your Ethereum wallet. Some tokens may need to be manually added if they're not auto-detected.

### How long does Power Down take?
13 weeks. Your Hive Power converts back to liquid HIVE in 13 equal weekly payments.
