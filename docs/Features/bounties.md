## ❓ FAQ

### Can I create multiple bounties?

Yes! Create as many as you want, just fund each one.

### What if no one completes my bounty?

You can extend the deadline or cancel and recover your funds (minus any spent on posted submissions).

### Can I submit to my own bounty?

Generally no - it would be unfair. Create bounties for others to attempt.

### What if there's a tie?

The creator decides. They might split the reward or pick based on other factors.

### How do I know a submission is legit?

Videos must be new and unedited. The community helps call out any suspicious submissions.

### Can the reward increase?

Yes! Others can add to the bounty pool to increase the reward.
