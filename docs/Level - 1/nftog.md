sidebar_position: 6
---

If you've known <a href="https://discord.gg/skatehive" class="button-link" target="_blank">**Skatehive Discord**</a> for some time, you know that we love involving our community in decision-making. Now, it's time to take the next step by launching our own Governance Token, the <a href="https://zora.co/collect/eth:0x3ded025e441730e26ab28803353e4471669a3065/1" class="button-link" target="_blank">**Skatehive OG NFT collection**</a>.


### About SKTHV OG NFTs

SKTHV OG NFTs are your digital pass to anything Skatehive-related! Owning a SKTHV OG NFT proves the holder's OG status in our community, allows Skatehive to establish a more decentralized and transparent voting system, and gives holders the power to propose their own ideas, as well as shape the future of Skatehive.

SKTHV OG NFTs 'live' on the Ethereum blockchain and are tradable, burnable, and the first Skatehive NFTs.

### Why SKTHV OG NFTs

Here are the main reasons we’re launching Skatehive OG NFTs:

- Engage the community more in decision-making
- Decentralize decision-making
- Reward OGs and builders with a piece of Skatehive history
- Motivate the Skatehive community to propose new ideas
- Kickstart our ETH treasury

We will drop SKTHV NFTs to the OGs (list <a href="https://hackmd.io/4DlwVzkoTry2bPOreTL_8A" class="button-link" target="_blank">**Here**</a>) who helped build our community and are still active on the blockchain, as well as all active content creators on our main platform <a href="https://skatehive.app/" class="button-link" target="_blank">**Website Skatehive.app**</a>.


If your name is on the <a href="https://hackmd.io/4DlwVzkoTry2bPOreTL_8A" class="button-link" target="_blank">**List**</a>, reply with your ETH address in this post so we can transfer your NFT to you. NFTs will be sent in bulk transactions every 2 weeks.


> 1st Transaction - August 1  
> 2nd Transaction - August 15  
> 3rd Transaction - August 30...  
> Final Transaction - October 20

### Buy an SKTHV OG NFT

If your name is not on the list and you still want to purchase one, you can buy an SKTHV OG NFT for 0.033 ETH <a href="https://zora.co/collect/eth:0x3ded025e441730e26ab28803353e4471669a3065/1/mint" class="button-link" target="_blank">**Here**</a>.


Buying an SKTHV NFT allows you to participate in governance while supporting the community treasury. 100% of SKTHV NFT earnings will be kept in the <a href="https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x5501838d869B125EFd90daCf45cDFAC4ea192c12" class="button-link" target="_blank">**Website Skatehive Vault**</a> and the community will decide how and where the funds will be spent through proposals on <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/skatehive.eth" class="button-link" target="_blank">**Website Skatehive Snapshot**</a>.


The price of the SKTHV OG NFT will double every 3 months and will be available for purchase for 1 year. The only way to obtain a SKTHV OG NFT after the sale ends (in 1 year) will be by purchasing one on the secondary market.

### Skatehive Governance Experiment

We’ve come a long way in the past 4 years! We've built a solid community, a rewarding skate social media app, sponsored events, launched online and real-life contests, rebuilt DIYs, helped community members with medical accounts, and much more.

All of this has been made possible thanks to our incredible community, so think of SKTHV OG NFTs as a thank you to anyone who has been/is part of this journey, not as a way to make money, because they don’t. It’s an experiment to decentralize the way we make decisions about the future of our favorite skate community, while also securing some funding to build more cool things!

Our ultimate goal is to give 100% of decision-making power to the community, and SKTHV OG NFTs are a step in that direction. Let’s continue to empower the skate community like never before!

🔴 *Disclaimer: SKTHV OG NFTs are our first governance experiment, and the numbers are subject to change (VP, quorum, etc.) as more and more people get involved.*
