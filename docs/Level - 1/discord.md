# Discord Tutorial: Connect, Share, and Create

Hey, folks! We know you can't stop gossiping on WhatsApp, but letâ€™s talk about the best platform to connect communities worldwide and coordinate towards a common goal â€” **Discord**.

## Why Discord?

Discord offers **separated rooms** and **roles**, which act like tags. These roles give users more features and access, helping manage communities effectively.
