## What is Skatehive?

**A decentralized magazine by skaters, for skaters.** No corporate overlords, no algorithm bs. Every skater owns Skatehive.

When you post, you're writing a page in **Infinity Mag** — our collective digital zine. Your tricks, your spots, your voice. Forever.

## Why It Matters

Skateboarding media has been controlled by corporations and Big Tech platforms that:
- Take your content
- Control the narrative
- Keep the rewards

**Skatehive changes this.** You own your content. You earn from your posts. The community decides what's valuable.

---

## How It Works

### Post & Earn
Share clips, photos, and stories. Get rewarded directly by the community through upvotes. No middlemen.

### Community-Owned
Built on Hive blockchain. Open-source. Decentralized. Anyone can fork it, build on it, or create their own skateboard frontend.

### Infinity Mag
Every post becomes a page in our living magazine. Skaters curate it, skaters read it, skaters own it.

## A Legacy of Tech + Skateboarding

Technology has always pushed skateboarding forward:
- **VX1000** brought cinema to the streets
- **DVDs** distributed skate videos globally
- **mIRC servers** let us share rare clips
- **Web 2.0** gave us the share button

**Skatehive is the next evolution:** Own your content. Earn from your creativity. Build with your crew.

## Open-Source Network

Skatehive is open-source. Any skate shop, crew, or community can:
- Clone the code
- Build their own frontend
- Join the network

All posts broadcast across the network. More visibility, more support, more opportunities.
