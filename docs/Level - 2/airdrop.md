## First Time with EVM Airdrops?

- If this is your **first time interacting with an EVM airdrop**, your wallet will ask for permission to interact with the airdrop contract.
- Once granted, the **second transaction** should trigger automatically.
- If it doesnâ€™t, simply **click the button again**. (*Weâ€™re improving this process.*)
