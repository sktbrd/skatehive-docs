# Join Skatehive

Skatehive is a global movement of skateboarders building together on the web.  
To join, you’ll need a web3 identity—either an Ethereum or Hive wallet. While Ethereum wallets are quick to set up, a Hive wallet unlocks the full Skatehive experience.

We know the process can feel a bit complex right now, but we’re actively working on ways to make joining even easier. For now, just follow the steps below—it’s worth it!
