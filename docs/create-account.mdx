3. Once you click **"Looks Good, Go For It"**, it will prompt a Keychain transaction. After you approve, the account will be created, and your friend will receive an email.

### Important: Keep Your Keys Safe
- **Never lose your keys!** They cannot be recovered if lost.
- Skatehive.app does not store copies of your keys for security reasons. It’s your responsibility to store them securely.

### Logging In
Use your username and password to log in to Skatehive through any browser. However, we recommend using **Hive Keychain** for the most secure experience.

## 2. Setting Up Hive Keychain

**Hive Keychain** securely stores your private key information. It’s available as a browser extension for desktop and as a mobile app (which also serves as a web browser). Use it to log into Hive frontends, including Skatehive.

### For Mobile Users
1. Create a PIN to unlock the keychain.

### Steps:
1. Make sure you have **Hive Keychain** installed.
2. Go to [HiveOnboard](https://hiveonboard.com/create-account) and create your account.
