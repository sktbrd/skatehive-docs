# Discord, here we go... 

Ok, folks listen up! We know you cant stop gossiping in whatsapp, but the best app to connect community around the world for those who are trying to coordinate themselves towards a common goal is discord. 

## Why is it good? 

In discord we can have separated rooms and roles, roles are like tags you can give to an user that will enable the user more features or more access

### Secret Commands 

 Do you remember 411VM?

411 Video Magazine (commonly abbreviated as 411VM or 411) was a skateboarding video series. 411 was created in 1993 by Josh Friedberg and Steve Douglas. 411 released four issues per year, until its last issue, issue 67 was released in 2005. Prior to 411, professional skateboarders only showcased their video footage in major video releases, which were sometimes spread years apart. 411 gave skateboarding fans access to videos of professional skateboarders more frequently than ever before.[citation needed]

411 was originally produced on VHS tapes, and then later transitioned to DVD

You can kill some of your nostalgia by typing the following command in the "bot-commands" chat

!411vm
