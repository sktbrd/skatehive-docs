# The Skatehive Governance Experiment
    
We've come a long way the past 4 years! We've build a solid community, a rewarding skateboarding social media app, sponsored events, launched online and real-life contests, re-built DIYs, helped community members with medical bills and many more. 
    
All that was done thanks to our awesome community so think of SKTHV OG NFTs as a thank you to anyone who was/is a part of this journey and not as a way to make money cause they are not. It's an experiment to decentralized the way we take decisions about the future of our favourite skateboarding community and at the same time get some funding to build more cool shit!
    
Our ultimate goal is to give 100% of decision power to the community and SKTHV OG NFTs is a step towards this direction. Let's keep bulding and empowering the skateboarding community like never before!    
    
🔴 *Disclaimer : SKTHV OG NFTs are our very first governance experiment and numbers are subjected to change (VP, quorum, etc.) as more and more people get involved*
