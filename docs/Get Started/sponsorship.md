# Account Sponsorship

Sponsorship lets experienced Skatehive members help newcomers get full Hive accounts for free. It's one of the best ways to grow the community!

---

## 🎁 What is Sponsorship?

**For New Members:**
- Get a full Hive account without paying
- Start earning rewards immediately
- Post with your own name (not @skateuser)
- Build your reputation on Hive blockchain

**For Sponsors:**
- Help grow the Skatehive community
- Support your friends
- Build your network
- Earn recognition (sponsors appear on leaderboard)
- Costs only ~3 HIVE (~$0.60)

---

## 💡 How It Works

### The Process

1. **New member signs up** with email on Skatehive
2. **New member requests sponsorship** (gets a shareable link)
3. **Sponsor clicks link** and approves the request
4. **Sponsor pays ~3 HIVE** to create the account
5. **Hive account is created** and auto-linked to member's account
6. **New member can now post** with their own Hive identity!

### What Gets Created

When you sponsor someone, Skatehive creates:
- ✅ New Hive blockchain account
- ✅ Posting keys (for creating content)
- ✅ Active keys (for transfers/voting)
- ✅ Owner keys (for account recovery)
- ✅ Memo key (for encrypted messages)

The new member receives all these keys securely via email.

## ❓ FAQ

### How long does sponsorship take?
Account creation is usually instant, but can take up to 24 hours during high demand.

Yes! Unlimited. As long as you have HIVE in your wallet.

### What if the person never uses their account?
The HIVE is already spent, but you still get credit as a sponsor. Choose wisely!

Once approved and paid, it cannot be cancelled. The blockchain transaction is permanent.

### What if I don't know anyone to sponsor me?
Post in [Skatehive Discord](https://discord.gg/skatehive) #sponsorship channel! Active members often sponsor newcomers with good vibes.
