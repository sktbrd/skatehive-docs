## ❓ FAQ

### Do I need a Hive account to use Skatehive?
No! You can start with just an email. Upgrade to Hive later when ready.

### Can I link multiple wallets?
Yes! Link as many identities as you want (Hive, ETH, Farcaster, etc).

### What if I forget which method I used to sign up?
Try email login first. If that doesn't work, check your email for previous magic links.

### Is my wallet safe?
Yes. Skatehive never asks for your private keys or seed phrase. We only request signatures to verify ownership.

### Can I remove a linked wallet?
Yes, go to Settings → Account → Manage Connected Identities → Disconnect.

### What happens if I lose access to my email?
If you've linked other identities (Hive, ETH), you can still log in with those. If not, contact support.
