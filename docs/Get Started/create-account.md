## ❓ FAQ

### Can I use the same email for multiple accounts?
No, one email = one account. But you can link multiple wallets to that account.

As long as you've linked a Hive or Ethereum wallet, you can log in with those instead.

### Can I change my username?
No, usernames are permanent. Display names can be changed anytime.

### Is my email stored on the blockchain?
No, emails are stored securely in our database, not on any blockchain.

### Do I need cryptocurrency to sign up?
No! Email sign-up is 100% free. You only need crypto if you want to upgrade to a full Hive account.
