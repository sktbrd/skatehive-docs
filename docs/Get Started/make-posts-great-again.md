# How to make your posts great

## 🛹 Your Skatehive Post Is a Magazine Page

When you post to Skatehive, you’re not just uploading content —
**you’re writing a page in our community zine.**

    📰 Every Skatehive post becomes a page in the community’s infinite skate zine.

The left side shows your post featured in the Skatehive magazine interface. The right is the raw content you created. That means:
📖 **every photo, line, thought, or poem you drop is part of our collective story.**
So… make it count!

## ✍️ Make Your Post Hit Hard (and Look Cool)

Here are some creative and helpful suggestions:

### 🧭 Tell Us About the Spot

- Describe the session.
- Share who was there.
- Drop a Google Maps link if it’s public.
- Talk about the vibes, challenges, or weather — give the scene some color.

> _“I found this crusty spot behind an abandoned mall — perfect ledge height, dusty floor, but somehow it worked.”_

### 🧠 Use AI for Support — But Keep It You

- Ask ChatGPT to organize your ideas or fix grammar.
- But **write with your own tone** — AI can assist, not replace your voice.

### 🌐 Write in Any Language

- Spanish, Portuguese, Tagalog — all welcome.
- Most frontends (like Skatehive.app and PeakD) support **AI auto-translation**.
- Your local slang and culture enrich the zine.

### 🛹 Talk Gear

- What board setup are you riding?
- What wheels or trucks?
- Are you filming with a phone, a VX1000, or a GoPro?
- Mention gear brands, DIY rigs, or your filmer's style.

> _“Filmed on a cracked iPhone taped to a broomstick — but the tre flip came out clean.”_

### 🎤 Add Personality

- Include poems, sketches, music lyrics, playlist links.
- Add memes or AI art if it fits the vibe.
- Make it yours — posts with unique flair **stand out** and feel alive.

> _“The trick wasn’t even the hardest, but something about the way the light hit the spot made it feel like a dream.”_
